# VoRtex-School
VoRtex School is a virtual worlds platform for education. Developed in Unity game engine using UNet networking, IBM Watson, Forge Networking, OpenCV, MySQL and Ethereum.

Educator needs are represented through the following system requirements:

•	Implement an access system for user authorization and authentication (security)

•	Enable tools for creating a virtual classroom without additional program-ming skills (VW design)

•	Enable the deployment of the virtual classroom to end-users on cloud serv-ers or local (institutions) machines (scalability)

•	Enable virtual assists during the session that support teachers for prede-fined courses (content generation)

•	Design immersive environment that can be used via different user interfac-es (Communication using PC desktop or VR devices)



The VoRtex prototype adapts the MicroLessons concept. MicroLessons are ses-sions prepared and created by the teacher using a web platform or the client applica-tion on a desktop PC. Also, the MicroLessons structure includes challenges like prob-lem-solving puzzles for different use cases like learning a new programming algorithm or exploring space to find required objects. MicroLesson practical examples are:

•	Build 3D interactive simulation (introduction to game development)

•	Bank resource management and critical thinking (introduction to finance and decision making)

•	Real-world physics (a lesson about laws of physics)

•	Scientific method (chemistry and biology)

•	Flora and Fauna exploration (vegetation and animal)

•	Earth exploration and time travel (geography and history)
