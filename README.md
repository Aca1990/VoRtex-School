# VoRtex-School
VoRtex School is a virtual worlds platform for education. Developed in Unity game engine using UNet networking, IBM Watson, Forge Networking, OpenCV, MySQL and Ethereum.

Educator needs are represented through the following system requirements:

•	Implement an access system for user authorization and authentication (security)

•	Enable tools for creating a virtual classroom without additional programming skills (VW design)

•	Enable the deployment of the virtual classroom to end-users on cloud servers or local (institutions) machines (scalability)

•	Enable virtual assists during the session that support teachers for predeined courses (content generation)

•	Design immersive environment that can be used via different user interfaces (Communication using PC desktop or VR devices)



The VoRtex prototype adapts the MicroLessons concept. MicroLessons are sessions prepared and created by the teacher using a web platform or the client application on a desktop PC. Also, the MicroLessons structure includes challenges like problem solving puzzles for different use cases like learning a new programming algorithm or exploring space to find required objects. MicroLesson practical examples are:

•	Build 3D interactive simulation (introduction to game development)

•	Bank resource management and critical thinking (introduction to finance and decision making)

•	Real-world physics (a lesson about laws of physics)

•	Scientific method (chemistry and biology)

•	Flora and Fauna exploration (vegetation and animal)

•	Earth exploration and time travel (geography and history)
